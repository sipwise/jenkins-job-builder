      "message": "This concerns me quite a bit given that my use of defaults up to now has always been based on the non-deep update behavior. That is to say, I expect keys in my jobs/job-templates to completely override keys in my defaults.\n\nWith this new behavior wherever I was previously overriding defaults in my job templates I will have to explicitly override every subkey. I would like to see it made optional, either through the command line or the jjb configuration file. The default behavior should remain the same.",
