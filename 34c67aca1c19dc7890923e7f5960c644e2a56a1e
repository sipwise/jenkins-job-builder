      "message": "This concerns me quite a bit given that my use of defaults up to now has always been based on the non-deep update behavior. That is to say, I expect keys in my jobs/job-templates to completely override keys in my defaults.\n\nWith this new behavior wherever I was previously overriding defaults in my job templates I will have to explicitly override every subkey. I would like to see it made optional, either through the command line or the jjb configuration file. The default behavior should remain the same.",

      "message": "Your scenario can be simple implemented by setting customized defaults name in defaults section.\n\nSuch as,\n\n-defaults\n    name: global\n    xxxx:xxxxxx\n\n-defaults\n    name: customized\n    xxxx:xxxxxx\n\n-job\n    name: job_name\n    defaults: customized\n\nActually, I think the purpose of defaults is used to specify some attributes that are not included/set in the jobs\u0027 configuration. So deep update behavior is reasonable.",
