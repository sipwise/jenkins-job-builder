      "message": "To avoid loading ConfigParser and maintaining a list of potential exceptions, I would rather check whether the config has the option. That is done at other place. Ie something like:\n\n if self.config.has_option(\u0027job_builder\u0027, \u0027keep_descriptions\u0027):\n     keep_desc \u003d self.config.getboolean(\u0027job_builder\u0027, \u0027keep_descriptions\u0027)\n else:\n     keep_desc \u003d False\n\nThat is imho nicer and easier to understand than catching exceptions.\n\nIdeally we would have all the defaults applied in cmd.py when initializing the configparser. But that needs a bit more work.",
