It also avoids some of the odd flow behaviour currently exhibited by this section.\n\ne.g.\n\n    :arg list binding-type: List of each bindings to create.  Bindings may be\n        of type `zip-file`, `file`, `username-password`, `text` or\n        `username-password-separated`. \u0027username-password\u0027 sets a variable\n        to the username and password given in the credentials, separated by a\n        colon. \u0027username-password-separated\u0027 sets one variable to the\n        username and one variable to the password given in the credentials.",
