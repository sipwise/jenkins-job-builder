      "message": "I\u0027d be included to put the \u0027lock\u0027 reference at the end of the filename and wouldn\u0027t bother with hiding it, assuming it\u0027s already using the standard cache dirs it\u0027s already under a hidden path, so no need to make the file hidden as well. Seems to be more conventional, and easier to associate with the cache file that way.\n\nMinor style nit, might want to put these below the __init__() and prefix them with \u0027_\u0027 to mark them as intended to be for private usage. Probably should have done that for a few other methods in this as well but we didn\u0027t think of that at the time.",
