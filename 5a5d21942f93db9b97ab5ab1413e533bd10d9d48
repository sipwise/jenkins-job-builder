      "message": "The motivation was to include the \u0027buildNeedsWorkspace\u0027 element only if explicitly stated if it should be true or false.\n\nAnyway, I\u0027ve tried to send XML without \u0027buildNeedsWorkspace\u0027 element to a job which previously had it. It looks like Jenkins looks up somewhere (?) the previous value of the missing element and adds it back on the next run (or when viewing the configuration in the GUI).\n\nThis double conditional was inspired by the \u0027disabled\u0027 option, which seems to work the same way.\n\n\nPlease advice what should be the correct behaviour:\n\n1) Include the \u0027buildNeedsWorkspace\u0027 element no matter what, defaulting to \u0027false\u0027. (This would mean adding this element in the flow tests as well and in real configurations too)\n\n2) Leave it up to Jenkins to fill in the missing elements. This is similar behaviour as with the \u0027disabled\u0027 option.",
