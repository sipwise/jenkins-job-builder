Removing that example entirely would left the feature undocumented.\n\nCan we come up with an example that does not use a variable and reference bug #1298568. Something like:\n\n - job-group:\n     name: job-group-name\n     jobs:\n         - \u0027{name}-build\u0027:\n             param: \u0027value\u0027\n         - \u0027{name}-upload\u0027:\n             dest: \u0027site.example.com\u0027",
