      "message": "Don\u0027t think InvalidAttributeError correctly converts the sequence provided to just get the keys in this case. so valid_dict, most likely needs to become valid_dict.keys().\n\nProbably need to extend some of the tests to support testing some exceptions a bit easier in general. In this case it should be possible to just check that output of the exception in the added test case contains the expected string.",
