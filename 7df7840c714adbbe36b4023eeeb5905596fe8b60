      "message": "I think need to document some of the gotchas, the anchors/aliases will be dependent on load order, and this does mean that it will no longer be safe to re-use an anchor elsewhere, so potentially we should be either warning or erroring on encountering an anchor overriding a previous definition.\n\nI\u0027m not sure the load order of recursive files/directories is completely predictable across OS, do you know what it\u0027s based on?",

      "message": "Fair point. os.walk calls os.scandir() or os.listdir() depending on Python version, and the docs for both explicitly state that \"entries are yielded in arbitrary order.\"\n\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.scandir\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.listdir\n\nOne fix, as suggested, is to change the recurse_path function in jenkins_jobs/utils.py to sort dirs alphabetically in the manner shown here - https://stackoverflow.com/a/18282602/504611 - and update the docs for the option to note this behaviour.",
