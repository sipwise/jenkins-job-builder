      "message": "Sorry I am late on this change and come with yet another enhancement request!\n\nThe list of available parameters are listed in the browserdict and then repeated in the error message. That is a recurring feature in the code and some publishers just display the dict key. You could thus use:\n\n \u0027Browser entered is not valid must be one of: %s\u0027\n % \u0027, \u0027.join( browserdict.keys() )\n\nThis way we avoid \"code\" duplication.  The two drawbacks are that you will have to amend this change yet again and that we are replacing the final \u0027and\u0027 with a comma.\n\n:-D",
