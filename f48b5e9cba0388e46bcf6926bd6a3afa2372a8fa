      "message": "Was pointed out to me recently that imports should be done as the following with blank lines between each grouping, essentially http://docs.openstack.org/developer/hacking/#import-order-template:\n\n import system\n\n import third-party\n\n import project\n\n try/except imports\n\nThe last one isn\u0027t codified, but based on discussions with the person that wanted it this way in order projects, I think I agree that it\u0027s probably better instead of trying to mix that in with the other import groups\nSo looks like this should be something like:\n\n from functools import wraps\n import logging\n from multiprocessing import cpu_count\n import threading\n import traceback\n\n try:\n     import Queue as queue\n except ImportError:\n     import queue\n\nAware that JJB is not good at following this convention, so wouldn\u0027t normally suggest, but believe there is a small change to be made anyway so think this can be fixed at the same time.",
