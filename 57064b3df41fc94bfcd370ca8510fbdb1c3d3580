      "message": "Since you set a default it requires someone to set the \u0027fn\u0027 arg to \u0027None\u0027 to get the else behaviour. Until this lists the jobs on the server, the if/else is redundant since returning a glob if one is set isn\u0027t useful. \n\nYou could just change this line to be something like the following (untested):\n\n jobs \u003d [j.name for j in self.jenkins.get_jobs()\n         if not jobs_name_globs or matches(j.name, job_name_globs)]\n\nAnd it should get the jobs from the remote and apply the filter\n\nBut I think it should be one or the other, remove the if/else or add the call to get the current jobs from the master.",
