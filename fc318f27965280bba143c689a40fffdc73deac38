      "message": "Thinking about what the best way to handle this is, because we want to discourage the use of fail_required\u003dFalse unless absolutely necessary.\n\nThe reason is because \"Optional\" parameters in Jenkins are ambiguous. For example let\u0027s say you set a boolean setting to True, and then decide you don\u0027t want that setting anymore and remove it from the YAML definition. XML generated for that setting is not produced. In Jenkins sometimes this means keep the previously configured setting but intuitively you might think it should be switched to False.\n\nThis was why fail_required\u003dTrue was introduced and we\u0027ve been trying to switch all the plugins to use it and ensuring every setting has a default fallback setting.",

      "message": "I wonder if it would be a good idea to move only the options that would generate an empty tag to the optional_mapping.\n\nBecause that is the problem, as an empty tag still triggers the Repo plugin to generate the commandline option that requires an argument, but the argument is empty (I am not sure why, looking at the code an empty string should be converted to null and if the option is null).\n\nBut moving only the options with default value \"None\" to optional_mapping would still get you the behaviour that you described I think, right?\n\nI will upload a new patchset for this.",
