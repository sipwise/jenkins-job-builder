      "message": "I\u0027ll try to clarify again:\n\nIf you do not specify \u0027threshold\u0027 in the YAML file: \u0027markBuildUnstableWhenThresholdIsExceeded\u0027 is set to \u0027false\u0027. The build will not be set to unstable since this disables the feature completely. I only set \u0027bugThreshold\u0027 to 0 in order to mimic the behavior of the Jenkins Web UI. The value is ignored by the plugin.\n\nIf you do specify \u0027threshold\u0027 in the yaml file, then \u0027markBuildUnstableWhenThresholdIsExceeded\u0027 is set to \u0027true\u0027 and now the plugin does evaluate the \u0027bugThreshold\u0027 value. As you mentioned the 0 means now that the build is set unstable for 1 or more bugs.\n\nDoes that help? Maybe you can suggest then how I should change the description.\nWould a comment help in the code, explaining that the 0 is ignored in the default case.",
