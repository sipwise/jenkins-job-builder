I don\u0027t really like the fact that module code is directly reading values from the config_parser since, ideally, module code shouldn\u0027t care where this value comes from (even if the most logical place seems to be the builder.conf).\n\nTwo solutions I can think of include:\n\nAdd a \"futures\" section to JJBConfig so this would be\n    if jjb_config.future[\u0027param_order_from_yaml\u0027]:\n\nWait did I say two solutions? I meant one. As far as this particular setting is concerned, we are going to wait for JJB 3.x to make \"param_order_from_yaml\" the default behavior, right?",
