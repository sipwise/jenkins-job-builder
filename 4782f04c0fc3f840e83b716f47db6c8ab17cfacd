      "message": "Do we need to filter the plugin info at all? What happens if you just dump it directly to yaml?\n\nThe existing yaml files in the tests are just the minimal plugin info subset of info used in the code.\n\nThis may not be python 2/3 compatible, just from familiarity with the patterns we needed in the CacheStorage or Builder classes when writing out the file correctly for various encodings.\n\nTesting shows that the resulting yaml file in python2 contains \u0027!!python/unicode\u0027 entries. I\u0027d need to spend some time testing but I suspect that may cause problems in the code looking to compare plugin names.\n\nWhich suggests we need a test to exercise the command code with a dummy plugins response. Which would of course be easier if we could switch it to use stdout and capture it.",
