      "message": "Seems to be suggesting that it\u0027s not interesting to know that the reason a job wasn\u0027t removed, is that it\u0027s no longer managed by JJB? I think maybe we should keep this behaviour since we also have a change to add XML tags to the jobs that get removed if some edits via the UI and saves the job. In such a case, the decision not to remove the job and just ignoring it complete might be confusing.\n\n(Copied from earlier comment)",
