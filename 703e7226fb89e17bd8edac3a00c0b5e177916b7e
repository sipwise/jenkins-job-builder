      "message": "I\u0027m conflicted about this.  I think false should be the default but David is right that it might potentially break existing JJB execution in the wild :(\n\nAlso it\u0027s a nice touch to allow this to be configurable but I don\u0027t see a use case for setting this to true at all.  Why would anyone want to allow duplicate jobs?  \n\nMaybe this should just be set to NOT allow duplicates and NOT configurable?  This will just force users to fix their job configurations which isn\u0027t a bad thing right?",

      "message": "It would seem that the existing behaviour is wrong. And if we allow by default, users that aren\u0027t aware of this override behaviour will most likely end up being caught out by surprise. I think defaulting to the behaviour an end user would expect to be sensible is better than adhering to perfect backwards compatibility. Unless the suggestion is that it should be this way for a single release only with the breaking change of switching the default to be made after the next release?\n\nAntoine Musso has a use case of allowing duplicates which is why I included a config option to ignore.\n\nIn this case that block duplicate job names by default, those that need to override this behaviour can update their configuration to allow duplicates, and can do so before upgrading JJB without breaking their existing set up.",

      "message": "I would even consider going a step further and not make this config option toggleable. If JJB can detect duplicate jobs it should error on duplicates. This isn\u0027t backward compat so we can bump the major version number and let people know about the change and how to clean up their configs.\n\nThe reason I say this is having duplicate jobs means one job will win. Which job wins isn\u0027t going to be clear to users so if you are in a position where you have duplicates you may be getting very confusing and hard to debug results so failing and notifying the user is desirable.",
