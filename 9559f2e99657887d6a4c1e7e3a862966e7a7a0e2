      "message": "I believe it is at least beneficial for everything in the cmd subdir. In fact, my intention currently is to move your fake_os_walk into this file or one like it within the cmd sudir once https://review.openstack.org/#/c/68895/ is merged. Then I will replace the use of os_walk_side_effects with fake_os_walk since I like what you\u0027ve written and would prefer more consistency across unit tests.\n\nKeeping it in a separate \"utils\" directory makes it clear that this is useful for mocking `os.walk` wherever that functions might be used--not just for the cmd unit tests. It also establishes a convention for such generally useful code.\n\nPlease let me know if you still think this utils module should sit in the cmd subdir, I just wanted to make my case for leaving it here before I go to the trouble of moving it.",
