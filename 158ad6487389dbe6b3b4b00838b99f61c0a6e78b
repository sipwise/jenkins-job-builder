The others are about naming consistency; which, granted, I should probably write up in the README. But basically, I\u0027d like the YAML keywords to be all lower-case and use hyphens rather than underscores (there\u0027s some old code that\u0027s inconsistent on that point, someday we\u0027ll deprecate it out).",
