For example:\n\n - parameterized-timer:\n     \u0027@midnight\u0027:\n         - PARAM1\u003dvalue1\n         - PARAM2\u003dvalue2\n     \u0027@hourly\u0027:\n         - PARAM1\u003dvalue1\n         - PARAM2\u003dvalue2\n\nor maybe there\u0027s a smarter way to do this in a usable way. I\u0027d be curious to hear what other reviewers think.",
