      "message": "I don\u0027t think we need a new section for yaml loading in this case.  IMO loading yaml is just a step in building jobs, not something separate enough to warrant a new section therefore i think we should move these to job_builder section.\n\nAlso there\u0027s a proposal to add a recursive option for loading yaml files ( I126751e347622716c592c6ed1a57b8acb7bf79a4).  I think hat option naturally fits in job_builder section.  To be consistent both recursive and include_path should go together.",
