I am open to other suggestions.\n\nWe could use \"bleading\", \"edge\", \"optional\". \n\nWhat I like about risk is that we can later extend it to run multiple other commands that do improve testing in less than common scenarios.\n\nUsually risk is non voting, at least for start. If it proves to be stable over longer period of time we could make it voting.",
