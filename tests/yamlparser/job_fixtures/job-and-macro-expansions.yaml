# Example for tickets:
# https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2010588 Expand macros even if called without arguments
# https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2010963 Expand jobs the same way as job templates are expanded

# Demonstrate different style of variable expansion and inclusion tags for
# macroses with and without parameters and for jobs versus job templates.
