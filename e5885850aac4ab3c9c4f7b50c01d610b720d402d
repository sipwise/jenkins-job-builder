      "message": "\"use only use\" should be fixed.\n\nThis message seems a little unclear to me; there\u0027s no mention that people seeing it are currently just using the default behaviour, nor what that default behaviour actually _is_ (so people may not understand what\u0027s going to change).\n\nPerhaps:\n\nThe default output behaviour of `jenkins-jobs test` when given the --output flag will change in JJB 3.0.  Instead of writing jobs to OUTPUT/jobname.xml; in JJB 3.0, they will be written to OUTPUT/jobname/config.xml.  You can enable the new default behaviour by passing --config-xml (which will continue to behave the same way in JJB 3.0).",
