      "message": "Sure, we can move it to the base_email_ext method. Since this is a basic functionality, it would make sense there.\n\nI do not have practical experience with this plugin, but I am guessing that this option is there for the scenario when you do not want to alter the recipient list, even for testing purposes. The switch transition from testing would be a simple checkbox (or a simple variable, in this case) away.",
