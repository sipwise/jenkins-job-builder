Unset this config \u0026 reupload job\n\nDoes the previous setting stick or does it get removed/reverted to whatever the default for the plugin is?\n\nWe\u0027ve found in the past that \"optional\" settings have very different meaning depending on the Jenkins plugin and that unconfiguring a setting sometimes means to reset to a default of the plugin and other times it means to keep the previously configured setting. We\u0027re starting to prefer setting defaults rather than optional settings in cases where unsetting a setting keeps the previously configured setting so that JJB can be more deterministic in what happens if a setting is unset.",
