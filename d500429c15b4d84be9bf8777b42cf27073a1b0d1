      "message": "The lazy-load-jobs001.yaml doesn\u0027t work  when i replace \u0027include-raw\u0027 with \u0027include-raw-escape\u0027.  I think this is  confusing because the docs currently say you should use \u0027include-raw-escape\u0027 for files with braces.  I think we should either support \u0027include-raw-escape\u0027 for this use case OR add documentation to let users know that you cannot use \u0027include-raw-escape\u0027 in this case.  I would prefer the former if it can easily be done.",
