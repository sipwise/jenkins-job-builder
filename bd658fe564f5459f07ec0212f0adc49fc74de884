      "message": "Yes, it\u0027s actually the same as File Path. So if we\u0027re calling File (File Path) then to be consistent we should call Topic (Topic Path) too. In the Gerrit Trigger UI both are simply called \"Topic\" and \"File\" though.\n\nEither way works for me but I thought we should be consistent if we were going to go with one or the other. Regardless I wouldn\u0027t stop this patch from getting merged for something this minor.",
