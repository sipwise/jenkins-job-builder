      "message": "I think this would require a callback function support in the convert mapping function to handle supporting where there is additional transformation of the data. In this case it would probably be something like:\n\n    (\u0027includes\u0027, \u0027libIncludes\u0027, [], lambda x: \u0027 \u0027.join(x))\n\nThough we would need to decide whether it is a good idea to have both the valid values and callback functions occupy the fourth element slot.",
