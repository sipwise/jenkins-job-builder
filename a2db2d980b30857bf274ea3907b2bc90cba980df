If we want to verify we throw a warning that should probably be done in a different fixture and I have no idea how detect a message is logged, might not be worth it.",

      "message": "gerrit002 should not cause the warning.  Did you mean gerrit003?\n\nBoth files need to keep the settings:\n\n- In gerrit001 we test that the config is generated correctly when only defined at the project level.\n\n- in gerrit003 we test that it uses the ones from the \u0027branches\u0027 section when defined both at the project level and in \u0027branches\u0027\n\nI don\u0027t think it\u0027s worth detecting the logged message.  IMHO it\u0027s enough that we test that the resulting XML is as expected.\n\nWould it be worth adding \"and support will be removed in a later version\" on the warning?  Then later we can remove the support and the warnings, making this code a bit less complex.",
