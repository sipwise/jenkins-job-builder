      "message": "@Darragh I believe in one of your comments on https://review.openstack.org/132927 you suggested that I write a version comparison function, which is what you see here. I think it actually ends up being pretty awkward... especially as additional version comparisons are introduced in various modules. I\u0027m also not sure there is really a clean way to compare to different versions with a function on the ModuleRegistry class.\n\nI\u0027ll probably modify this patch to look something like \n\njenkins_version \u003d self.registry.get_plugin_info(\"Jenkins Hipchat Plugin\").get(\u0027version\u0027, 0)\njenkins_version \u003d pkg_resources.parse_version(jenkins_version)\n\nif jenkins_version \u003e\u003d pkg_resources.parse_version(\"0.1.8\"):\n  do_something()\nelse:\n  do_something_else()\n\nLet me know what you think of that.",
