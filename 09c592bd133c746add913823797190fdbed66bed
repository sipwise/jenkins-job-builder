      "message": "If one only wants to compare one branch he will still be able to define them as before i.e.:\n\n  branch-compare-type: foo\n  branch-pattern: bar\n\nOr using the new style:\n\n - branches:\n  branch-compare-type: foo\n  branch-pattern: bar\n\nThat is nice for back compatibility.\n\nYou might want to emit a warning when discarding data. Ie whenever a project has branches, tell the user that the branch-compare-type and branch-pattern defined at the project level are skipped.",

Added warning for both cases:\n\n- project defines a branch only in the project level; warn that it is deprecated and branches section should be used.\n\n- project defines a branch at project level, and one or more in branches section; warn that it is deprecated and data from project level is discarded.",
