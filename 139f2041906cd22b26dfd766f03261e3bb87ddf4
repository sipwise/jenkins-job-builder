      "message": "What happens if credentials-id is defined on the job but username/password is in the config file? Seems like we need to decide in what order things should override here first.\n\nFor users I would suggest that existing of settings on jobs should be taken in preference to the config file which means that you need to check for both the username/password and the credentials-id being defined on the job first, then check if either is in the config file.\n\nOtherwise how do I set credentials for specific jobs? it\u0027ll work as long as not of these settings are in the config file.",
