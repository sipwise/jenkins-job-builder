      "message": "Need to be able to distinguish between a list and a string here. \u0027iter(\"string\")\u0027 is valid and will iterate over each letter in the string, which isn\u0027t correct as we wouldn\u0027t want that behaviour for single filenames.\n\nOptions:\n- support fn being a single string, a list or an object with a read method\n- support fn being a list or an object with a read method\n- require that fn is a list and check whether each item has a read method or not and parse accordingly\n\nI started with option 1, but I\u0027m open to rethinking what should and shouldn\u0027t be supported here in the name of sensible code :)",
