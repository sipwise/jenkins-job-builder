      "message": "i initially left out reporters in test since it required maven. Now i\u0027ve enabled maven in the test so it has the full list.\n\nI *think* zuul, hiphat and metdata would require something similar to what is needed for project (custom logic for insertion at the proper location) thus I would prefer to leave that out until I can have enough proper time to test and verify it.\n\nI believe with the current from `raw` support is already very useful so I would prefer that goes in rather than waiting for all the special cases to be covered.",
