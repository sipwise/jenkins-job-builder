      "message": "I am a bit concerned about this change in behavior. IOError is thrown if the file could not be opened. Maybe it couldn\u0027t be opened due to file permissions or a path tyop. There are many cases like that where the resulting string shouldn\u0027t be interpreted as valid yaml.\n\nI think we may want to deal with this at a slightly higher level and make it clear when we are parsing a string directly or parsing the data within a file? Perhaps a second method which can also call _parse_implementation that is called explicitly when appropriate?\n\nI am open to ideas though as I am not very thrilled with my suggestion either.",

      "message": "I\u0027m not sure if you are familiar with the original code which was a single method parse(self, fn) and the first line was: yaml.load(open(fn)) \nThis is the behavior I\u0027m trying to separate out. To that end I have kept the public method the same, though I agree it is now slightly less legible since fn can have multiple meanings. If this was from scratch, I would have named this method something like load_yaml() and had the parse method be the _parse_implementation. Since we have to support the existing user base this seemed like the safest approach. Totally up for suggestion here.\n\nIn this implementation though, it is easier to override the parse method to load however you want without having to worry about how the data itself is actually manipulated. Which is not the case today.",
