      "message": "I am a bit concerned about this change in behavior. IOError is thrown if the file could not be opened. Maybe it couldn\u0027t be opened due to file permissions or a path tyop. There are many cases like that where the resulting string shouldn\u0027t be interpreted as valid yaml.\n\nI think we may want to deal with this at a slightly higher level and make it clear when we are parsing a string directly or parsing the data within a file? Perhaps a second method which can also call _parse_implementation that is called explicitly when appropriate?\n\nI am open to ideas though as I am not very thrilled with my suggestion either.",
