      "message": "Assuming switching which method is mocked to allow testing which jobs are actually deleted with the glob, the following would be correct method to use I imagine?\n\n delete_job_mock.assert_has_calls([\u0027bar001\u0027, \u0027bar002\u0027], any_order\u003dTrue)\n\nMight be overkill in some cases, but seems like for checking that the glob matching is working it might be a good idea here.",

      "message": "Thanks Darragh!  I tried to do this before but gave up because i couldn\u0027t figure out how to validate that the glob extracted the correct jobs.  \n\nI tried as you suggested using the assert_has_calls method but that always fails for me.  I stepped thru the method and I think there\u0027s a bug in there and that\u0027s why it always asserts.  Instead I used assert_any_call method and that seems to work as expected.",
