I\u0027m thinking we possibly shouldn\u0027t use it directly.\n\nAnd I\u0027m not sure we need to do anything other than use a standard dictionary, since we don\u0027t care about the underlying implementation which is hiding the fact that you can use either the short or long name to retrieve the plugin shouldn\u0027t be something we should worry about testing here, unless we want to also use python-jenkins to check some code my providing it with some plugins data to parse into a suitable format.",

      "message": "If python-jenkins API would not have returned instances of this class by themselves I would had agreed with you. \n\nI think that it would not be a good idea to use something else in this case because we are using this only for testing. Using other classes would mean that we would test something else than real life scenario.\nAlso I think that one issue is comparing two python dictionaries.",

However we\u0027ve completely isolated python-jenkins here from these tests and we\u0027re not testing that we can parse the data correctly, but rather it is getting passed through from one area to another in the expected manner.",
