      "message": "The previous code would generate code compatible with both old and new plugin provided you didn\u0027t need to use the new names.\n\nThis new code will mean that existing yaml will no longer generate XML compatible with the old plugin.\n\nLooks to me like the most reasonable fix would be to change the if statements to see if the returned value is not \u0027None\u0027. That way the user can at least set it to False to disable.\n\nProbably the most compatible solution until we can support retrieving the actually plugin version and then control the XML being generated depending on what is compatible with the target version of the plugin.",
