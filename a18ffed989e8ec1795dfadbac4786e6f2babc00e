The feature I\u0027m adding is the first one described in this changelog: https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/GitHub+Plugin#GitHubPlugin-Version1.10%28Nov17%2C2014%29\n\nWhich, under jenkins, is a build step. I guess you could move it around and make it happen before or after another build step, since it\u0027s sending a \u0027pending\u0027 status to the github status API. In which case, location does matter.\n\nIt\u0027s definitely not a post-build step as it\u0027s supposed to report a \u0027pending\u0027 status to github before your builds build.",
