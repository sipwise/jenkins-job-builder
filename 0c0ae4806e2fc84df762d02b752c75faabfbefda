It\u0027s much better than the initial fix that I found of stripping the weird \"v${SHORTSHA}\" from the version string that I initially thought it was.\n\nWe found this particular bug because of the latest version of the postbuildscript plugin getting a security update and then our not being able to deploy JJB to our Jenkins systems!",
