If there is a need for it (it is late on Friday I am probably just missing something obvious) can we keep the parameter names to this function consistent with the parameters of the outer function? (data vs entity, top vs entity_xml, and child_mapping isn\u0027t needed as mappings is available in the inner scope)",
