I think it\u0027s a good idea to follow this as it\u0027s much cleaner when adding numerous patterns to be able to specify them as a list of individual items.\n\nDocstring would just need to note that since the separator is hardcoded as a \u0027,\u0027, any use of that in the patterns would likely need escaping.",
