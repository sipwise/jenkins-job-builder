      "message": "Original patch removed this since it is a workaround for the problems with the minidom module printing invalid XML in python 2.6.\n\nThis regex was an attempt to remove the whitespace that minidom added around the text data in elements, which is invalid according to XML specifications. Whitespace between different elements is ignored in XML, but whitespace around data is significant.\n\nHowever this regex code has problems in ensuring that it did not remove whitespace between multiple levels of tags resulting in a slight variation in the XML outputted when run under python 2.6 versus python 2.6. While this whitespace difference has no effect on the resulting uploaded jobs (although it would remove an additional blank line from scripts that were included by the \u0027include\u0027 tags - subsequent patch), it made it difficult to ensure the XML output being checked by tests was correct when dealing with XML elements of sufficient depth (anything less than 3 levels deep of child elements was unlikely to trigger this).\n\n\nWith the code at the top of this file which fixes the \u0027minidom.Element.writexml\u0027 method for python less than 2.7, the output generated by minidom.parseString() is now correct and the regex no longer modifies the output.",
