Project check if \u0027keepall\u0027 is defined, and map it to \u0027keep-all\u0027 if that is not defined, include a warning for keepall being used, and a second one if both keepall and keep-all are set in saying that the value of keepall will be ignored in preference to keep-all.\n\nBit cumbersome, important for backwards compatibility.",
