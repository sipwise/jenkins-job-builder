      "message": "This job definition is missing a \u0027job-template\u0027 section to be valid.  If this test doesn\u0027t fail due to YAMLStructureError then it will still fail due to the missing template.  I think this test case should have only 2 outcomes, either YAMLStructureError OR JJB processes it without errors.   Therefore I suggest going with a simpler test.  something like this..\n\n- job:\n  # The code below is incorrectly indented.\n  # It should be indented more.\n  name: \u0027missing_indent\u0027\n  builders:\n    - shell: \u0027echo {name}\u0027\n\n\nThis test will check for the invalid yaml case while there are already many existing tests that process valid yaml.",
