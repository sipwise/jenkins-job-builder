      "message": "\"Deprecated\" and \"no longer supported\" are 2 entirely different concepts. When you deprecate something you are logging a warning that support will be removed in a future release but users can continue to use this feature for the time being. So I would argue that you are not \"deprecating\" a feature if you are removing it\u0027s support entirely.\n\nTypically we follow semvar in JJB so we would deprecate in the current version, and remove support when/if we release 4.x version later in the future. Do not assume people are upgrading to the latest version of software because there are many organizations that are slow at getting the latest releases out. For example OpenDev is still on Gerrit 2.13.\n\nFor features that have changed their input keys can we support the old format as a fallback (set the default to get value from the old configuration while new configuration overrides)?\n\nThen just leave a warning so that folks have time to migrate their configuration until we release a major version that breaks backwards compatibility like 4.x.",

I went too far with these changes, for the benefit of simplified implementation and maintenance.\n\nThe idea with defaults from the old input keys and overriding with the new ones is fine for me. I will update the code accordingly.\n\nOne more question regarding \"trigger-for-unreviewed-patches\" - is it OK to completely drop support for it as it\u0027s no longer supported by the plugin since v2.14.0, so for almost 5 years now?",
