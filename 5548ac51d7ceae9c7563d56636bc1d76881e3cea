There appears to be a suggestion at https://github.com/jenkinsci/copyartifact-plugin/blob/1f34b2557f8bbf182e9cd97184685df364e8fff7/src/main/java/hudson/plugins/copyartifact/CopyArtifactPermissionProperty.java#L86 that the code stores projectNameList as a string and splits it up internally.\n\nIt certainly suggests that it would be saved to the config as a list of strings, but the UI interface would pass it through as a single string. I wonder if that is where the original confusion came from.",
