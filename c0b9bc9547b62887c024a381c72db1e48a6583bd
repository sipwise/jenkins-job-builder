      "message": "I think the recursive walking of paths is possibly better done outside of this class, as I think that it\u0027s better to have any manipulation (i.e. pattern matching to exclude/include) on the paths to walk done as part of the command line processing rather than within the class.\n\nI think that makes it much easier to treat this as an API that other tools can call.",

And it would make it tidier when adding \u0027exclude\u0027 capabilities later :)",
