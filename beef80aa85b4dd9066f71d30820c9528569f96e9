Only the mapping above with the properties-file etc.. should have the False setting.\n\nWe should leave this bottom one fail_required\u003dTrue. Basically ideally we want fail_required\u003dTrue when possible. Setting it to false is an exception in cases where we want to allow optional values. Rather than forcing required, or defaults.",
