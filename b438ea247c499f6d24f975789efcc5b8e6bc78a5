      "message": "I\u0027m wondering is this testing what should be tested here? \n\nThis checks that the config object has the correct value set, before it checked whether the object used to communicate with jenkins was created with the timeout parameter, which made sure that the logic inside the JenkinsManager constructor object was exercised.\n\nPerhaps we want to plan to move that part of the test to those dedicated to testing the JenkinsManager object? I\u0027m ok with that and keeping this for checking that the option in the config file updates the timeout correctly here.\n\nThough potentially that too should go to a set of tests dedicated on testing the config processing.\n\nBased on comments previously I\u0027m just a little wary of ending up with lots of unit tests exercising individual objects when possibly better on having something closer to functional tests for the subcommands.\n\nThoughts?\n\nPretty happy to let this land as is, and follow up based on what is suggested as future improvements.",
