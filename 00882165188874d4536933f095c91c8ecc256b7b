      "message": "Flowdock uses tokens to identify the flow (or room) to send notification events. So each token is tied to a room. With this being the case, I\u0027ve had requirements for different jobs to report to different \"flows\" / rooms. That\u0027s why I think the Flowdock plugin allows for separate tokens for each job. Not sure that having a global default would be valid in most cases.",
