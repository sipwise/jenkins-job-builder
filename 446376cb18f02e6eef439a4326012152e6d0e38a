      "message": "Looks like there is a subtle formatting gotcha with sphinx here, need to reduce the indent on each line by 2 spaces. It\u0027s wrong in a few places so guess we\u0027re frequently forgetting to check the resulting layout :-(\n\nTake a look at the resulting http://docs-draft.openstack.org/41/156141/4/check/gate-jenkins-job-builder-docs/b4a4680//doc/build/html/scm.html for what I mean. The additional three lines don\u0027t quite flow as I\u0027d expect.\n\nYou can check the resulting changes locally by running:\n\n tox -edocs\n firefox doc/build/html/scm.html\n\nHowever since it was already broken in the same manner before and we need to fix it in multiple places, I\u0027m going to go with this can be fixed in a subsequent patch which sorts out the odd doc formatting across the entire file.",
