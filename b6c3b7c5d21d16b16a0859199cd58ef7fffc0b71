      "message": "Cool. What variable name would you suggest? Are you referring to `what` (which I also don\u0027t love)\n\nIn the standard library in the re module, they use `string`, which is perhaps marginally better. https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html",

      "message": "Sorry, should have been more verbose. A \u0027glob\u0027 is type of pattern, so saying \u0027glob_patterns\u0027 is like saying the same thing twice. Would have just gone with \u0027globs\u0027\n\nI\u0027d probably go for a more terse version such as:\n\n def matches(what, globs): \n     return any(fnmatch.fnmatch(what, pattern) for pattern in globs)\n\n\nBut like I said, it\u0027s not really an issue, just personal preference.",
